# Abstract

This Power BI project analyzes survey data from professionals in data roles like data analysts, engineers, scientists, and architects. It provides insights into average salaries, job satisfaction, work-life balance, popular programming languages, and how difficult it is to break into these careers. The dashboard is interactive, allowing users to explore data by country, job role, and satisfaction level, offering a clear picture of the current state of data professions.

# Tools I Used

Excel: For initial data cleaning and exploration.
Power BI: To model data, create visualizations, and build interactive dashboards.
Git & GitHub: For version control and project collaboration.

# Conclusion

In this project, I sharpened several skills and gained valuable insights into data professions. 

- **Tools and Skills Developed:**
  - **Excel:** I used Excel for the initial stages of data cleaning and exploration, reinforcing my skills in handling raw data and applying basic transformations to prepare the dataset for analysis.
  - **Power BI:** This project significantly enhanced my ability to model data, create interactive dashboards, and build visualizations that tell a story. I learned how to leverage Power BI’s functionality to break down complex datasets and highlight key trends, such as salary satisfaction and work-life balance.
  - **Git & GitHub:** I deepened my understanding of version control, using Git and GitHub to manage project updates and collaborate efficiently. This ensured smooth tracking of changes and seamless integration of updates into the project.

- **Key Insights:**
  - I gained a comprehensive view of the different data roles and the varying levels of salary satisfaction, work-life balance, and challenges in breaking into the field. 
  - Understanding the global landscape for data professionals was eye-opening, especially in terms of how respondents from different countries like India and the U.S. perceive their careers.
  - The insight into programming language preferences (Python being dominant) has also provided a clearer view of industry standards for data-related jobs.

- **Additional Learning:**
  - **Data Modeling in Power BI:** One of the key challenges was effectively modeling the survey data in Power BI. I learned how to handle complex relationships between tables, which allowed for cleaner data visualization and better user interaction in the dashboard.
  - **Data-Driven Storytelling:** This project reinforced the importance of visual storytelling. Beyond just displaying raw numbers, I learned to transform data into a narrative that helps users quickly grasp key takeaways.
  - **Survey Analysis:** Analyzing survey data gave me insight into how to interpret qualitative responses and quantify aspects like job satisfaction, programming preferences, and career challenges.
